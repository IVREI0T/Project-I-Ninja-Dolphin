  ### [Ninja Dolphins](https://github.com/t3m1X/Project-I-Ninja-Dolphin)

Raiden is an arcade vertical scrolling shot'em originally released by Seibu Kaihatsu. 
This is our version of the game, with new graphics and mimicking the original gameplay.
In order to get the highest score you must destroy the enemies and try to advance as far as possible.
If you get shot, you will need to start from the beggining. Good luck!
