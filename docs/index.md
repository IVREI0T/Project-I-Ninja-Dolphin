Raiden is an arcade vertical scrolling shot'em up released by Seibu Kaihatsu in September 1990. It contains 8 stages with different weapons, enemies and a final boss fight at the end of each stage. Once the final boss is defeated, the player can move on to the next level. There is no way to finish the game so when you complete all of the 8 levels it starts again from level 1 with increased difficulty.

The plot takes part in a science fiction future (year 2090) where planet Earth is attacked by aliens called Crannassians. In order to fight them, humans created the Raiden Supersonic Attack Fighter.
